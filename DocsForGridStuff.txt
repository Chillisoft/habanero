The only difference between BusinessObjectPanel and BusinessObjectControl
is that BOPanel has a PanelInfo Prop and BOControl does some error stuff

why are these different
what is the damn error stuff for?

BOControl at least has some tests
BOPanel has no tests.
BOControl does nothing with VWG BOPanel Implements the VWG Windows pattern

Neither of these implements any buttons.

Change DefaultBOEditorForm to use one of the Editor controls instead of building the Panel since it is doing an identical thing.




FormController - Could easily change this to do tabs etc like the NakedObjects
IFormControl


What does this do ICollectionTabControlMapper

what does this do IControlManager

IGridAndBOEditorControl and IGridWithPanelControl what is the difference
These are trying to achieve an identical objective but merely come from a different time period GridAndBOEditor is used by the ExtendedComboBox 
whereas GridAndBoEditorControl appears to be used by Firestarter.



ISelectedListViewItemCollection is currently commented out what is this.

The actual controls that inherit from this pop up a form in which you can edit existing value, Add values or delete values of the Business object loaded into this combo box.

NNB where need readonly use ReadOnlyCollection can also be generic


Every Business Object must have a default UI. The default UI must have both a grid and a form.
