            WS-Routing is a simple, stateless, SOAP-based protocol for routing SOAP messages 
            over a variety of transports like TCP, UDP, and HTTP. With WS-Routing, the entire 
            message path for a SOAP message (as well as its return path) can be described 
            directly within the SOAP envelope. It supports one-way messaging, 
            two-way messaging such as request/response and peer-to-peer conversations, 
            and long running dialogs.
