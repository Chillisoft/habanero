Our fictitious computer 
parts supply business, Replace-IT, has grown beyond all expectations and  
orders are raining down from all over the country.&nbsp; It wasn't going to be long before our 
makeshift stock control system would begin to crack up.&nbsp; The poor 
receptionist is spending hours each day logging calls from irate customers whose 
orders have either been wrongly fulfilled or have simply slipped through the 
cracks.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It's time for a customised system, and being an 
IT firm, we feel we have enough know-how to code our own system.&nbsp; So off we 
go, load up the coffee machine, crank up some rock music and pull out the SQL 
manual for the first time.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">We've decided to code the system in C# with 
object orientation, using the MySQL database to store the parts and sales data.&nbsp; 
MySQL is a relational database, which means it will be good for reporting.
After getting "Hello, world" working and taking fifteen minutes to celebrate, 
it's heads-down for the real grind.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">And it all grinds to a halt.&nbsp; Having drawn 
up a plan of our object structure, we then sit down and map out the database 
table structure.&nbsp; It suddenly dawns on us: how do you reconcile the two?&nbsp; 
Surely there must be a simple way?&nbsp; And it sure is going to be a mission to
write up all the database connection code and all the SQL statements to move the data
back and forth between the database and the application.  With a splatter of keyboard strokes and 
a tick-tick of mouse buttons, our browser calls up the Habanero architecture to solve all 
the world's problems ... well, except for global warming.</font></p>

<p class="tuthead"><span class="tutcat">The Problem</span></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The hunt is always on to find an easier, quicker, cleaner and more 
error-free way to achieve a programming task.&nbsp; Despite continued 
innovation, there are still some glaring efficiency gaps, such as the jagged 
interface between relational databases and object-oriented code.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Habanero was developed by a group of software 
developers that ran into the continuous problem of having to provide the 
intermediate between object-oriented code and database tables.&nbsp; 
A pattern of usage developed and Habanero was packaged 
together with recurring functionality from the different applications.&nbsp; Furthermore, the architecture 
remained in use by the team for a long period before being released onto the 
market, considerably improving stability and ensuring that the software is 
relevant to real-world business needs.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">What sets Habanero apart from other flavours of 
persistence or object-relational mapping (ORM) solutions is the ability to 
generate user interfaces that are automatically mapped to the object as well.&nbsp; 
The implication is that you can build a functional database-dependent 
application with visual results in far less time, which is also great news for those
interested in building prototype applications for their clients.

		<p>This is a more theoretical explanation of the Habanero framework.&nbsp; If you prefer a 
hands-on approach, you can skip this section and come back to it later.</p>

<p class="tuthead"><span class="tutcat">What Does Habanero Try to Fix?</span></p>

<p>Habanero attempts to tackle two primary problems.</p>
<p>Firstly, there are a number of repetitive steps required to copy values from 
relational databases, which are not object-oriented, to objects in code.&nbsp; 
Database connections need to be coded and managed, and the particular quirks of 
each database vendor need to be understood.&nbsp; Then Sql statements must be 
written for each type of action (create, read, update, delete) and for each 
property of each object.&nbsp; Concurrency checks need to be done, and some kind 
of mapping for inheritance and relationships must also be managed.&nbsp; In 
short, there's a vast amount of work covered in these actions, and what's more 
frustrating is that they are largely repetitive from project to project.&nbsp; 
Equally, making small changes to a database structure can result in a large 
amount of readjustment in the code as well.</p>
<p>
Secondly, there is considerable repetition in designing a user interface and 
mapping each control to a property, as well as ensuring that each property 
provides up-to-date values that reflect the database content.</p>
<p>Of course, individual requirements for user interfaces can vary vastly, and 
it is unlikely that any one solution can automate most developers' requirements.&nbsp; 
However, Habanero does provide a large array of functionality to create full 
user interfaces or components of a user interface, and then map these to 
properties as the developer specifies.&nbsp; These properties are then kept 
up-to-date by the background engine as you use the components at run-time.&nbsp; 
Depending on your application, this can present a considerable time-saving.</p>


<p class="tuthead"><span class="tutcat">How Does Habanero Carry Out Mapping?</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Habanero requires a set of class definitions that are contained 
in a single XML file.  Here you specify:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Which classes map to which tables</li>
  <li>Which properties in each class map to which fields</li>
  <li>The primary key and any alternate keys</li>
  <li>Property rules, types and limitations</li>
  <li>Relationships between tables</li>
  <li>How user interfaces can display the class data</li>
</ul>

<p>
Habanero comes with Firestarter, a GUI application that can be used to
manage the class definitions for you.  If you use Firestarter,
much of the work in setting up and maintaining your
mappings can be automated.  You can simply start with an existing database
structure, then use Firestarter to generate the class definitions from the
database and then generate the code for these class definitions.
</p>

<p>
You can of course work directly with the class definitions XML - the XML
code used to achieve common tasks in this tutorial is included.
Carrying out the process manually, you would need to handle three steps, in any order. 
1) Design the database. 2) Create the classes. 3) Create the XML class definitions.
With regards to creating the classes, all entity classes are required to inherit 
from Habanero's BusinessObject. For each property value that must be mapped, the 
property will need <i>get</i> and <i>set</i> methods that use a Habanero-provided method to 
carry out the persistence.  The appendices contain the full API for the class definitions.
</p>

<p class="tuthead"><span class="tutcat">What are Business Objects?</span></p>

<p>Business objects are entities that in some way represent different components 
of business logic.&nbsp; For instance, in the manufacture of a car, 
the wheels, door, bonnet, seat and ignition all make up business objects.&nbsp; 
An email client provides more a more abstract example: an individual email, an 
address book, a blocked-senders list and a preference settings list could all be 
business objects.&nbsp; Essentially business objects are well used term in the 
IT industry to differentiate these kinds of components from other objects like 
widgets in a user interface or components of your database connection 
architecture.</p>
<p>Habanero's BusinessObject provides a range of common functionality to its 
inheritors.&nbsp; Most importantly it hands down the tools to carry out 
persistence of the properties to and from the database.</p>

<p class="tuthead"><span class="tutcat">What About Sql?</span></p>

<p>There is some debate at the moment on the wisdom of either hiding developers 
from the power of Sql or giving the developers open room to create errors 
through faulty Sql code.&nbsp; In Habanero, both sides are catered for to some 
extent.</p>
<p>At a simple level, you will hardly write any Sql while using Habanero.&nbsp; 
Basic persistence to and from the database is handled by Habanero, which 
automatically constructs the Sql needed for each property value and adapts each 
statement to cater for the supported database vendor you specified.</p>
<p>There are, however, times when you will need to use some level of Sql.&nbsp; 
At a simple level, you can place restraints on how many objects are loaded in a 
collection of business objects, and how these are ordered.&nbsp; These are 
provided using Sql criteria that will be appended to the Sql statements.&nbsp; 
Secondly, Habanero provides support for migrations, so that you can take an 
updated application to an outdated client installation, and the application will 
automatically update the client using the Sql statements you have provided.&nbsp; 
Finally, you can still execute a self-created Sql statement at any place in 
your code.&nbsp; You can construct the statement with a single string, or you 
can safely build a SqlStatement object out of components.</p>

<p class="tuthead"><span class="tutcat">Supporting Alternate Data Sources</span></p>

<p>
Habanero provides the structure to support data storage other than databases.  For
instance, testing can be done using an in-memory database that manages the data
during the lifetime of the application.  The current device is stored using the
GlobalRegistry.DataAccessor property.
</p>

<p class="tuthead"><span class="tutcat">Designing for Many UI Environments</span></p>

<p>
Habanero supports UI generation for forms and grids, so that developers can
automate much of their user interface design.  Even better, Habanero uses a
control factory structure, so that each control is an instance of an interface
and is created by a control factory.  With this design, you need only change the
control factory and you can convert your entire UI design to run in a different
UI environment.
</p>

<p>
Taking advantage Visual WebGUI by Gizmox, you can design one system to run
either as a desktop application, or as an online web application.  Visual WebGUI
simulates Windows Forms design for the web environment, giving you the advantage
of reduced development time and increased responsiveness.

		<p class="tuthead"><span class="tutcat">System Requirements</span></p>

<p>Habanero is a .Net product, so you will need to install the .Net 2.0 (or 
above) framework.&nbsp; You will also need to meet the .Net 2.0 minimum 
requirements.&nbsp; As far as application requirements go, this depends heavily 
on the type of application you will be developing.&nbsp; For client 
installations, you require Windows 2000 or above and will typically need a 
Pentium 4 1.6ghz, 256mb RAM for Windows 2000 or 512mb RAM for Windows XP.&nbsp; 
The minimum requirements for Windows Vista applications are not yet clear.</p>

<p class="tuthead"><span class="tutcat">Licensing &amp; Installation</span></p>

<p>You can obtain all editions of Habanero through the  
<a href="http://localhost:3000/habanero/download">Download</a> section.
The download file is a zip that contains two MSI installation files, one for the
Habanero framework with its DLL's, documentation and source code.  The other installs
Firestarter, the GUI application to manager the class definitions.
</p>

<p>
The source comes with test classes for
use with NUnit, which is a free testing framework - that way you will be able to
check if any of your changes break other parts of the framework.  Note that the
source code is distributed under the GNU Lesser GPL, implying that you cannot
sell the source code or any modifications to it.  If you have
fixed any bugs or made useful additions, it would be helpful to the community of
Habanero developers if you posted the code on the Habanero forum.  Some of this
code may be incorporated into future versions of Habanero.
</p>

<p>
More instructions on working with the source code can be found in the appendices.
</p>

<p class="tuthead"><span class="tutcat">Files &amp; Directories</span></p>

The Habanero installation will include the following folders:

<ul>
  <li><b>bin</b> - contains the Habanero DLLs</li>
  <li><b>source</b> - contains those parts of Habanero which are open source</li>
  <li>
  	<b>firestarter</b> - contains the FireStarter application
  </li>
  <li><b>docs</b> - contains Habanero documentation, excluding the tutorials, 
  which are only available online</li>
  <li><b>lib</b> - some additional DLLs that may be useful</li>
</ul>

<p>If you will be using logging in your application, download and install the 
log4net DLL's - see Appendix II for more information.</p>

<p>Once you have chosen the database vendor you will be using, follow the 
installation instructions for that database.&nbsp; Your Habanero-based 
application will need to reference the DLL's that come with that installation.</p>

<p class="tuthead"><span class="tutcat">Technical Support</span></p>

<p>Chillisoft provides various types of support for Habanero.  See the 
<a href="http://localhost:3000/habanero/support">Support</a>
 page for more information.  There is also a brief Troubleshooting section at the
 end of this tutorial.</p>

<p><font size="2">At this stage you'll have  chosen your database of choice 
and installed it. For this 
tutorial we'll be using the MySQL database.&nbsp; We open the database 
administrator and create a new schema called "replace_it".&nbsp; It's time for 
our first table, which will hold our computer parts.&nbsp; We'll call it 
ComputerPart - no surprises there.&nbsp;  The first column is "ComputerPartID" 
which serves as the primary key.&nbsp; Code conventions for C# use PascalCase for naming, so 
it's easier if we use that same convention in the database too.  Now there is some 
debate on primary keys and what format they take, but for our example, our 
primary key will be a Guid and will remain hidden from the user.&nbsp; In MySQL, a Guid can 
be represented as a CHAR(38) type.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The class definitions are held in an XML file and are used to 
describe how the database maps to the objects in code.  Habanero includes
FireStarter, which is a GUI editor that helps you manage them visually.
You can either set up the classes individually using FireStarter, or you can
have them generated from the database for you.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Before you open FireStarter, you will need to copy the DLL of your database
vendor (eg. MySQL.Data.dll for MySQL) into the executable directory of FireStarter in
your Chillisoft/Habanero installation.  Once you've opened FireStarter, create a new project
in FireStarter (through the File menu) called "Replace_it".  Then go to the Generate menu
and select "ClassDefs from Database".  The following window should appear:
</font></p>
<div align="center"><img src="HabaneroTutorial_files/fs-generateclassdefs.jpg"></div>
<p><font size="2">First add a Connection string that specifies how to access your
database. The Default Assembly indicates which project your class files will reside in.
Pascal Case refers to the naming of the classes and Table Name Prefix can eliminate
any prefix you have in front of your table (eg. if all your tables are tbsomething).
Tick the two Populate options for now, so that we can generate user interfaces for the
classes as well.  Ignore the Show Primary Keys options and the Append options, which prevent
a regeneration from adding columns or fields when you have previously chosen not to.  Then Test the connection
and Generate the definitions.  ComputerPart should now be listed.  If you have any
error messages, check that your connection string is correct (port 3306 is often a good
choice for a localhost server).</font></p>

<p class="tuthead"><span class="tutstd">Manual</span>
<span class="tutcat">Writing the Class Definitions Manually</span></p>

<p><font size="2">The class definitions are held in an XML file and are used to 
describe how the database maps to the objects in code.  A full list of the elements
and options available are listed in Appendix I.  Create an XML file
called "ClassDefs.xml" and insert the following code.</font></p>
<table class="code" border="1" cellspacing="0">
	<tbody><tr>
    <td class="codeclass" width="100%">
      <font size="2"><b>ClassDefs.xml</b></font>

    &lt;property name="ComputerPartID" type="Guid" /&gt;
    &lt;property name="Description" /&gt;
    &lt;property name="Price" type="Decimal" /&gt;
    &lt;primaryKey&gt;
      &lt;prop name="ComputerPartID" /&gt;
    &lt;/primaryKey&gt;
  &lt;/class&gt;
&lt;/classes&gt;</code></pre></td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>
Later on, once you've created your solution, you will need to add the XML file to your solution.
This file must be copied to the output directory of your application.  Right-click on
the project containing your ClassDefs.xml file, go to Build Events and add the following
Post-build command: <i>copy "$(ProjectDir)ClassDefs.xml" "$(SolutionDir)Replace_it\bin\Debug\"</i>
</p>

<p>
By the way, you can use Firestarter to export just the XML class definitions file for you,
rather than generating the whole project.  Keep in mind that if you make local changes to
your XML file and then export the class definitions from Firestarter, you may lose your
changes.  If you edit the XML directly, you may want to use Firestarter's import utility
which will import an existing XML file.
</p>



<p class="tuthead"><span class="tutpro">Auto</span>
<span class="tutcat">Auto-Generating a New Solution</span></p>

<p>
When you are starting a new project from scratch, Firestarter can generate the new
project for you as a solution (.sln) file that you can open in Microsoft Visual
Studio.  This will contain the assemblies, the business object classes, the launch
classes and some additional utilities.
</p>

<p>If you already have an application and want to take advantage of the code
generation, you can take one of two approaches.  Either generate a new project and
transfer your old code across to the new one, or generate a new project and transfer
the classes from the new project across to your old one.  The first option is better,
because regenerating the code after making some changes will not require the manual
transfer to be repeated.
</p>

<p>Code generation is done by Firestarter.  Once you've set up your class definitions, simply
go to the Generate menu and select "Generate Code".  The following window should
pop up:</p>
<div align="center"><img src="HabaneroTutorial_files/fs-generatecode.jpg"></div>
<p><font size="2">You might need to specify which Connection the new solution
will be using and you'll need to set the Solution Directory.  The Habanero DLL path
only needs to be supplied if you want the application to reference a different set
of DLLs to that which FireStarter is currently using.  As you can see, four projects
are created within your solution:</font></p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Replace_it</b> - The startup project that defines the environment</li>
	<li><b>Replace_it.BO</b> - Holds the business objects and the class definitions XML file</li>
	<li><b>Replace_it.Logic</b> - Holds the application's business logic</li>
	<li><b>Replace_it.UI</b> - Holds the user interfaces and form controller</li>
</ul>
<p><font size="2">Once you've clicked Generate you can open the project by
double-clicking on the .sln file (depending on your IDE).  Add your database vendor's
DLL to the references of the root project (eg. MySQL.Data.dll), and ensure that Replace_it is the default
startup assembly.  The project should compile and run successfully.</font></p>



<p class="tuthead"><span class="tutstd">Manual</span>
<span class="tutcat">Setting up the Solution/Project Manually</span></p>

<p><font size="2">Fire up your standard IDE or text editor and set up a new 
solution.&nbsp; If you're using Visual Studio, add new projects as recommended above in the Auto
solution.  For this tutorial, there should be one Windows Application project and the rest would be libraries.
First up we'll need to reference some DLL's that are important 
to our application.&nbsp; If you're using Visual Studio, 
right click on the References folder and "Add reference".</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font size="2"><b>Habanero*.dll</b> - These are the DLL's you installed.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2"><b>log4net.dll</b> - This is the logging system that 
  Habanero supports for outputting runtime information to a specified log.&nbsp; 
  See Appendix II for more information.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2"><b>MySql.Data.dll</b> - Used to manage MySql database 
  connections (if you're using a different database, you'll need to make 
  appropriate adjustments here)</font></li>
  <li><font size="2"><b>Noogen.Winforms.dll</b> - Used to 
  generate combo-boxes</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font size="2">If you've created a new project in Visual 
Studio 2005, you'll see that two classes have been added already: "Form1.cs" and 
"Program.cs".&nbsp; If you're using a different IDE, go ahead and create two 
equivalent classes for consistency.  We'll also integrate Habanero at this stage -
notice the "using" references, the two lines at the beginning of the "main" method and the
try/catch clause which provides a neat error message box.</font></p>

		<p>
We're about to explore a powerful feature of Habanero - generating user
interfaces for the objects we are mapping.  This works best when you
have a class with several properties that behave fairly simply and just
require information, such as contact details.  When you have a complex user
interface, Habanero can still generate most of the interface for you,
saving you the time of mapping the controls to the properties and checking that the values
supplied are valid according to the application's business rules.  You can then add
customisation on top of the generated controls.
</p>

<p class="tuthead"><span class="tutcat">Multiple User Interface Environments</span></p>

<p>A key feature of version 2.0 is the ability to design one application for multiple
environments.  This would have been unthinkable in the past, but with the launch
of Visual WebGUI by Gizmox, Habanero now allows you to design your user interface
independently of the environment, and you can switch between the environments
simply by changing your configuration.</p>

<p>The key to achieving this is the IControlFactory class.  Whenever you want to
create a control, like a TextBox, Grid or Form, simply call a method in the
application's ControlFactory, which will create the right control and make sure
it is customised for that environment.  For instance, apart from the obvious
namespace issues, one key difference between designing for the desktop and
designing for the web is the amount of events that are assigned.  If each
event causes a call to the server in your web application, you can understand
that Habanero ensures that controls for the web environment sacrifice some
usability in order to reduce bandwidth and lag in your web application.</p>

<p>The following diagram illustrates how controls are structured in Habanero, with
"Win" indicating controls from System.Windows.Forms and "VWG" indicating controls
from Gizmox.WebGUI.Forms.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="HabaneroTutorial_files/theory-controlfactory.jpg"></p>

<p>Most controls have a manager, which groups common logic used between all the variants
of a control.  The current ControlFactory is stored in GlobalUIRegistry.ControlFactory - there
is a default control factory initialised for you when you run StartUp on HabaneroApp.  In a
moment we'll see how to create controls using your ControlFactory.</p>


<p class="tuthead"><span class="tutpro">Auto</span>
<span class="tutcat">Managing UI Design in Firestarter</span></p>

<p>Using FireStarter, you manage which properties to display under each
class's "UIs" tab.  You can generate grids and/or forms, and specify
which control types to use to edit the data.  When you generate the
class definitions from a database, FireStarter can automatically
create the UI definitions as well.  The following screenshot
demonstrates what would have been created for a grid display of
computer parts:</p>

<span class="tutcat">Editing UI Class Definitions</span></p>

<p>
You might want to edit the UI class definitions directly in the XML.  The
result as viewed above can be added to your XML as follows for the
ComputerPart class:

<p>
You can see from the UI section of this definition that a lot is assumed about
the control types and the labels.  See the Appendix on Class Definitions for more information on how
you can control the layout and display of the different fields and columns.
</p>

<p class="tuthead"><span class="tutcat">Managing Multiple Forms</span></p>

<p>
When you generate a new project with FireStarter, the main form is set as an
MDI form, meaning that it can contain other windows within it.  The one
advantage of having several forms open at the same time is that when you
switch away from a form, you should be able to return to it in its
last state (unless you close it).  Habanero facilitates this with the
FormController class, from which we will inherit and adapt.
</p>

<p>First we'll create a form to show our computer parts, simply adding a new
file in the .UI project.  In order to merge this form into the form controller, 
it needs to inherit from UserControlWin and IFormControl.</p>

<p>We'll add code to load the computer 
parts from the database into a collection of business objects and make them 
available to be read by the grid.  At a later stage we'll want to use Sql
criteria with the Load() method to limit just how many parts we display. We'll also 
instantiate a grid and add it to the provided form. There are some grid variants -
this one is read-only and provides buttons to edit the selected row.  Note that we use the 
BorderLayoutManager supplied with Habanero - this was created to cover for user 
interface shortfalls in .net.</p>

<p>
You'll notice that when FireStarter generates code for a new project, a
class is already created in the UI project to control the forms.  You'll simply
need to add each form you create to the structure already provided:
</p>

<table class="code" border="1" cellspacing="0">
  <tbody><tr>
    <td class="codeclass" width="100%">
      <b><font size="2">Replace_itFormController.cs</font></b>
    </td>

    <td class="codeitself" width="100%">
      <pre><code>using System.Windows.Forms;
using Habanero.UI.Base;
using Habanero.UI.Forms;

namespace Replace_it.UI
{
    public class Replace_itFormController : FormController
    {
        public const string COMPUTER_PARTS = "Computer Parts";
        
        public Replace_itFormController(IFormHabanero parentForm, IControlFactory controlFactory) :
        		base(parentForm, controlFactory) { }
        
        protected override IFormControl GetFormControl(string heading) {
            IFormControl formCtl = null;
            switch (heading)
            {
                case COMPUTER_PARTS:
                    formCtl = new ComputerPartsForm();
                    break;
            }
            return formCtl;
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
Finally, in ProgramForm (the master application form in the root project) we tie the form controller to the main menu so that
the correct form opens and so that all currently open forms are listed under
the Window menu.  Note that in order to integrate with Habanero's UI structure, we change the form to inherit from FormWin
rather than Form itself.

around.  This can be amended in FireStarter by supplying a Title for the Form,
under the "UIs" tab.</p>


<p>Note that in this application we haven't included the 
ComputerPartID in the grid.&nbsp; This was partly a matter of choice and partly 
of principle.&nbsp; Regarding choice, a Guid is not as useful as a description 
when listing parts.&nbsp; Regarding principle, it's commonly held opinion that 
you shouldn't be changing your primary key, so we've designed the database to 
eliminate that possibility, keeping the primary key discrete.&nbsp; Of course, 
we will later add a unique reference number for each computer part, but that 
will be in a custom format rather than as a Guid, which is admittedly difficult 
to read and communicate.</p>

The ComputerPart class is very limited at the moment - we don't even know how many
parts we have in stock. We simply need to add a few more fields, but just how much work is
this going to be?  Change management is one area where object-relational mapping begins 
to shine.  Rather than update a whole range of SQL statements, we can manage this 
process fairly smoothly.
</p>

<p class="tuthead"><span class="tutcat">Updating the Database</span></p>

<p>
We'll need to begin the change process by updating the database. After adding 
some more important fields, our database structure now looks like this:

<span class="tutcat">Updating Code Automatically</span></p>

<p>
The process of updating your code is made easy with FireStarter.  Simply carry
out the generation steps again.  Firstly, call up the menu option "Generate &gt;
ClassDefs from Database".  Keep the same settings, except tick the two "Append" options,
so that any new fields will also be assigned to your grid and form property lists.
</p>

<p>
To update the code, regenerate the project using the menu option,
"Generate &gt; Generate Code", and keep the same settings as before.  FireStarter will
add the files that are missing and will update the business objects.  Re-open the solution
if you have added new classes and they don't appear.  Note that each business
object class is split into two partial files.  The first file (eg. ComputerPart.cs)
is where you can add your custom code, knowing that it won't be affected by a
regeneration.  The second file (eg. ComputerPart.Def.cs) holds the properties
and relationships and will be replaced each time you regenerate.
</p>

<p class="tuthead"><span class="tutstd">Manual</span>
<span class="tutcat">Updating Class Definitions &amp; Code Manually</span></p>

<p>
To update the class definitions, simply add the new properties and their types.
"String" is the assumed default type and the other types can be named either by 
their wrapper class names (eg. Int32) or their standard-use names 
(eg. int). (see Appendix I for  a  list of data types in the class definitions).
If you're generating user interfaces you will also add the new properties
to your UI listings where appropriate.

		<br>
		<p>We're ready to introduce orders received by customers and orders sent to suppliers.
It's easy to see that they have several things in common, making this
a good opportunity to explore inheritance.
</p>


<p class="tuthead"><span class="tutcat">Inheritance Strategies</span></p>


<p>Inheritance is one distinct feature supported by object-orientation but not 
by relational databases.&nbsp; Habanero as an object relational mapping tool 
translates an inheritance structure to database tables in three different ways.&nbsp; 
The default "ClassTableInheritance" uses one database table per class in the 
inheritance structure. All fields that are inherited from the parent are 
actually stored in the database table of the parent, while the child table only 
stores its ID, the parent's ID and any fields that are unique to the child.&nbsp; 
"SingleTableInheritance" maps all fields of all classes of an inheritance 
structure into a single table. "ConcreteTableInheritance" uses a table for each 
concrete class in the inheritance hierarchy, so that the fields of an abstract 
parent are stored in the child rather.</p>

<p>In our example, supplier orders and customer orders are very similar - they 
can both have an order number, name, price and delivery status.
These properties can all be abstracted to a parent PartsOrder class that
the user will never see.  ("Order" is a sql keyword)</p>

<p>Now to choose an inheritance strategy.&nbsp; Each one obviously has its pros 
and cons.&nbsp; The advantage of "ClassTableInheritance" is that we're 
not having to duplicate the fields of each inheritor in both the database tables 
and the class definitions - once they've been declared in the parent, they're 
inherited automatically.&nbsp; "SingleTableInheritance" places all the data into 
one table, which does reduce our control over the individual tables.&nbsp; 
"ConcreteTableInheritance" separates the data distinctly but does incur 
duplication.&nbsp; You can imagine that in a class with many fields, this 
duplication can add up to a lot of extra work.&nbsp; We'll go with the default 
for this example, although you may want to experiment with the other structures 
too.</p>

<p>Note that the inheritance format discussed below is one of several types
available.  For more information on other ways of implementing inheritance,
see the Wiki.</p>

<p class="tuthead"><span class="tutcat">Adding the Database Tables</span></p>

<p>Here are the three database tables.  At the moment we're keeping it simple and not
giving the child classes any fields of their own.  This is just temporary, and it's
easy to imagine that differences will begin to creep in. Foreign keys are created here
to prevent a parts order from being deleted while the child order still exists.  Out of
interest, there is no requirement for database foreign keys in Habanero, because Habanero
can carry out deletion prevention itself.  There are two advantages of adding foreign keys 
though - it helps FireStarter to detect relationships when generating the definitions
and it prevents accidental deletions if someone is editing the database directly.</p>

</p>

<p class="tuthead"><span class="tutpro">Auto</span>
<span class="tutcat">Auto-Generating the Classes</span></p>

<p>As you did in the "Managing Changes" section, use FireStarter to regenerate the
class definitions.  There are just some fiddly extra steps to take before you generate the
code.  FireStarter doesn't yet detect inheritance from a database schema, so go
to the CustomerOrder and SupplierOrder classes, select Super Class and assign
the PartsOrder class.  Secondly, delete the PartsOrderID properties in the two child
classes (since this is inherited).  Finally, jump across to the UI definitions for each class
and assign which properties you would like to display in those two classes.  The
multi-selector is an easy way of assigning the properties quickly.</p>

<p>FireStarter correctly picks up that the Delivered property is a boolean, but will
display a TextBox by default.  We'd rather use a CheckBox, so switch over to the "UIs"
tab and the "Form" tab, and change the Delivered control to CheckBox.</p>

<p>Subsequently regenerate the code as you did before, which should create three
new classes in your project.  Re-open your solution if the new classes don't appear.</p>

<p class="tuthead"><span class="tutstd">Manual</span>
<span class="tutcat">Adding the Class Definitions</span></p>

<p>In the child class definitions, the "superClass" element is used to indicate
inheritance and the PartsOrderID is left out because it's inherited.
If you're generating user interfaces, you'll also need to include UI
definitions for the child classes.</p>

		<p class="tuthead"><span class="tutcat">Introducing Relationships</span></p>

<p>Relationships have a range of uses, especially in providing content for combo-boxes
and relating a group of items that belong to a parent.  Order items are a perfect example -
the interesting challenge is how to describe this relationship.  In database design,
you create the child class and include a field that refers back to the parent, whereas
in code you would probably hold a collection in the parent class.  Habanero effectively
links both approaches.
</p>

<p>In addition to the relationship between a PartsOrder and OrderItems, we can also
create a relationship between the OrderItem and the ComputerPart it represents.
If we simply put a string for the part code field,
we're opening the system up to errors.  What if the part code changes format?  It's far
cleaner to change the part code field to an ID (in this case a Guid) that points back
to the original ComputerPart table.  The second advantage of this is that we can
easily construct a ComboBox, so the user simply picks the part code from a list.  The
third advantage is that giving us the ID of the ComputerPart means we're one step away
from all the other properties of that part, such as price and stock.</p>

<p>Relationships are usually described as 1-to-1, 1-to-many or many-to-many.  Many-to-many
relationships require an intermediate table, which we won't discuss here (there's plenty
of web material on this subject).  What concerns Habanero is the
immediate view from each class.  In other words, does this relationship point to single
or multiple objects?  For a PartsOrder, a multiple relationship points to all the items in
the order, and in an OrderItem, a single relationship points to the original order.
Similarly, in an OrderItem, a single relationship exists to the ComputerPart and a
multiple relationship points from the ComputerPart to all the OrderItems that use it.</p>

<p>Just a note here on deletion prevention.  Habanero provides three options for deletion
prevention on multiple relationships only.  Deletion prevention resolves the question of:
what happens if someone accidentally deletes a ComputerPart that is being used in an
OrderItem?  The deletion check goes on the ComputerPart's relationship rather than on
the OrderItem.  Habanero thus poses the question to a multiple relationship: can I delete
myself if someone is using me?  This works the opposite way to foreign keys.  The three
options are: prevent deletion, delete related (eg. delete the order items if I get deleted)
and dereference related (ie. in code, remove the reference so that the object will either
continue to belong to something else that references it or be cleaned up by the garbage
collector).  Prevention is the default and that's our preference in this example.

<p>While you regenerate the class definitions, you need to
watch that your previous changes are not overwritten.
For instance, the CheckBox control for the Delivery boolean (discussed
under Inheritance) may revert to a Textbox.  Simply turn off the two "Append"
options, to prevent previous UI definitions being appended to.</p>

<p>FireStarter detects relationships from the foreign keys you supply in the
database, so looking under the "Relationships" tab will show the relationships
we have discussed.</p>

<p>You can then regenerate the code as well, restarting Visual Studio if no OrderItem.cs class
is visible.  One last step is needed after generating the code - there is no way
to know which PartsOrder an OrderItem is associated with, so we can specify that
in the constructor.  The constructor must not be added to the OrderItem.Def.cs stub,
otherwise it will be overwritten in the next regeneration.</p>

<p>There are several ways to display the corresponding order items when you click

order grid will cause the order items grid below it to show the items for that 
order.</p>

<p>The principle challenge here is to copy across the PartsOrderID when a 
new item is added, otherwise we have no way of knowing what the parent order is.
The DefaultBOCreator creates a new object when we click "Add", so we'll simply
replace it with our own, passing the parent object to the constructor.  The overridden
CreateBusinessObject will be called by the grid control just before the editing

		<br>
		<p>Habanero has extensive support for generating user interfaces and provides
access to these controls so that additional behaviour can be assigned.  In this
section we'll look at some particular features available to the developer, along
with techniques used to achieve common tasks.</p>

<p class="tuthead"><span class="tutcat">Adding Lookup-Lists in a ComboBox</span></p>

<p>In the previous section we looked at how you can specify a lookup-list using
relationships.  A lookup-list is simply a set of options that the user can
select from for a particular field, such as a list of countries or a list
of address contacts.  Habanero allows you to provide values for a lookup-list
from a pipe-separated string (eg. gender options: "M|F") or from a database.  These lookup-lists are
defined under the property in the class definitions.</p>

<p>Combo-boxes in a user interface are populated from three types of lookup-lists: BusinessObjectLookupList, 
which creates a list from a set of loaded business objects, 
DatabaseLookupList, which builds a list from a given sql 
statement, and SimpleLookupList, where a static collection can be specified in 
the class definitions.</p>

<p>A lookup-list comprises a set of display-value pairs.&nbsp; The display part 
is shown to the user and the value part is the value actually stored.
The BusinessObjectLookupList provides the display part from the class's ToString() method, while
the DatabaseLookupList requires a value field and a display field in the select part of the Sql string.</p>

<p>To implement a combo-box for the ComputerPart in OrderItem, we'll first amend the class definitions.
In FireStarter, select OrderItem, change to the "Properties" tab, select ComputerPartID and go to the
"Lookup List" tab, where you can select the list type as "Business Object":</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="HabaneroTutorial_files/fs-orderitem-boll.gif">
</p>

<p>You could also have chosen the "Database" type, in which case you would have provided a sql string
as <i>"select ComputerPartID, PartCode from computerpart order by PartCode"</i>.</p>

<p>We also need to indicate that the control type to display the computer part will be a ComboBox.
Set this under the "UIs" tab:</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="HabaneroTutorial_files/fs-orderitem-ui.jpg">
</p>

<p>Finally, we'll need a revised ToString() method in the ComputerPart class which describes how
to display an instance in the combo-box.  Be sure to add this method in the ComputerPart.cs file
and not the ComputerPart.Def.cs file.</p>

<font size="2" face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica">

    </font><table class="code" border="1" cellspacing="0">
  <tbody><tr>

<td class="codeitself" width="100%">
    <pre><code>public override string ToString()
{
    return PartCode + " - " + Description;
}</code></pre>
    </td>
    
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>This should now run successfully, with the string display showing correctly in the grids and the combo-box,
but the Guid stored in the database.</p>

<p class="tuthead"><span class="tutcat">Fulfilling Orders</span></p>

<p>Where the Delivered field is set to false, we can now dispatch or receive orders 
and automatically amend the stock quantities.  One way of doing this is to add a button
on each orders grid. Add the following code at the bottom of the OrdersForm constructor:</p>

<font size="2" face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica">

    </font><table class="code" border="1" cellspacing="0">
  <tbody><tr>

<td class="codeitself" width="100%">
    <pre><code>if (typeof(T) == typeof(CustomerOrder))
{
    _grid.Buttons.AddButton("Dispatch", new EventHandler(DispatchClickedHandler));
}
else if (typeof(T) == typeof(SupplierOrder))
{
    _grid.Buttons.AddButton("Receive", new EventHandler(ReceiveClickedHandler));
}</code></pre>
</td>
    
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The DispatchClickedHandler and ReceiveClickedHandler are implemented further along. The parts 
stock is loaded and we check that all of the stock is available before 
changing stock levels. Note that we call Save() on the objects in 
order to persist the changes to the database, otherwise our stock will still be 
the same when we restart the application.</p>

<table class="code" border="1" cellspacing="0">
  <tbody><tr>

    <td class="codeitself" width="100%">
    <pre><code>private void DispatchClickedHandler(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    PartsOrder selectedOrder = (PartsOrder)_grid.SelectedBusinessObject;
    if (selectedOrder.Delivered.Value || selectedOrder.OrderItems.Count == 0)
        return;

    BusinessObjectCollection&lt;ComputerPart&gt; stockAvailable = new BusinessObjectCollection&lt;ComputerPart&gt;();
    stockAvailable.LoadAll();

    foreach (OrderItem orderItem in selectedOrder.OrderItems)
    {
        ComputerPart matchingPart = stockAvailable.FindByGuid(orderItem.ComputerPartID.Value);
        if (matchingPart == null)
        {

{
    PartsOrder selectedPartsOrder = (PartsOrder)_grid.SelectedBusinessObject;
    if (selectedPartsOrder.Delivered.Value || selectedPartsOrder.OrderItems.Count == 0)
        return;

        new BusinessObjectCollection&lt;ComputerPart&gt;();
    stockAvailable.LoadAll();

    selectedPartsOrder.Save();

</tbody></table>

<p>At this stage we have a basic stock management system.&nbsp; Using Habanero 
we've achieved this with very little contact with either the user interface 
designer or 
the database connections.</p>

<p class="tuthead"><span class="tutcat">Data Validation &amp; Property Rules</span></p>

<p>This is also a good time to introduce property rules (also known as validation). In our parts 
business, we obviously don't want a negative stock, so we can create a rule that 
prevents negative integers.&nbsp; A rule can be a combination of smaller rules, 
so that ranges can be created for instance.&nbsp; Using FireStarter, the rule can be assigned for
the Stock property of ComputerPart.  Similar rules could of course be designed for a wide
range of numbers, such as the Cost and Price.</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="HabaneroTutorial_files/fs-compart-rule.gif">
</p>

<p class="tuthead"><span class="tutcat">Better Number Control</span></p>

<p>While our user interface is functional, it's not very robust, and an 
experimental user could quickly bring our application down to earth by entering strange
characters into some of our controls.
We can exercise some control over our numbers input by using NumericUpDown controls.</p>

<p>The control types to be used in the user interface for the ComputerPart can be amended in
FireStarter as before, except that the mapper type needs to be specified.  The mapper is a
Habanero component used to map data back and forth between the object and the UI control.
When you specify the NumericUpDown control and leave the mapper as "Auto-Select",
the mapper defaults to NumericUpDownIntegerMapper.  This is fine
for the Stock property, but for Cost and Price you should manually specify the mapper as
NumericUpDownMoneyMapper, which assigns two decimal places.</p>

<p class="tuthead"><span class="tutcat">Filtering Grid Displays</span></p>

<p>Quite clearly, our grid displays could grow rather large as we begin to add 
computer parts or customer orders.&nbsp; There are several ways to limit the 
number of objects being shown.&nbsp; We could specify load criteria as a 
parameter in each collection's Load() command.&nbsp; Another simple way is to 
add a filter control, which filters out the rows to display, so that only those 
rows that meet a requirement are shown.</p>

<p>Looking first at the computer parts, how you filter your values will depend 
on how you distinguish your parts.&nbsp; For instance, Replace IT uses a part 
code made up of three letters which indicate the type of product and four 
numbers which serve as a sub-code for that type.&nbsp; For example, one of the 
optical mice might have a code of MOU1534.&nbsp; So our solution simply 
categorises items by their three first letters, doing a non-strict string 
comparison.</p>

<p>The Habanero FilterControl comes attached with the GridControl, but can also
be deployed independently.  You simply need to assign a set of filter controls
and specify which columns they filter out.  The GridControl automatically detects
when a filter control has been modified by the user and filters the grid immediately.
Keep in mind that the this filter only works on a pre-loaded collection, so your
grid will initially contain the full collection before filtering.
</p>

<p>In this example, the AddStringFilterComboBox method
creates a combo-box that searches for all objects with that given string
within the specified property.  There is also a free-type TextBox filter to search
on the Description field.
Add the following code at the bottom of the ComputerPartsForm constructor:</p>

<table class="code" border="1" cellspacing="0">
  <tbody><tr>
    <td class="codeitself" width="100%">
    <pre><code>string[] options = { "CDR", "KEY", "MOU", "HDD", "DVD", "MBD", "FDD", "CAS", "MON", "VID" };

grid.FilterControl.AddStringFilterComboBox("Category:", "PartCode", new ArrayList(options), false);
grid.FilterControl.AddStringFilterTextBox("Description:", "Description");</code></pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>This should create the following interface:</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="HabaneroTutorial_files/app-compart-filter.jpg">
</p>

<p>It would be nice to do something similar with orders, where we place a checkbox that
allows us to show only those orders that are still to be delivered.  However, the
Habanero checkbox filter is a strict "true" or "false" check, and doesn't provide inclusivity.
In other words, a ticked checkbox should show only "false" values, and an unticked
checkbox should show both "true" and "false" values, not just "true" values.  The
better approach here is a custom implementation, to be added at the bottom of the
OrdersForm constructor:</p>

<table class="code" border="1" cellspacing="0">
  <tbody><tr>
    <td class="codeitself" width="100%">
    <pre><code>ICheckBox checkBox = GlobalUIRegistry.ControlFactory.CreateCheckBox();
checkBox.Text = "Undelivered orders only";
checkBox.CheckedChanged += delegate
   {
       BusinessObjectCollection&lt;T&gt; col = new BusinessObjectCollection&lt;T&gt;();
       if (checkBox.Checked) col.Load("Delivered = 'false'", "");
       else col.LoadAll();
       _grid.SetBusinessObjectCollection(col);
   };
manager.AddControl(checkBox, BorderLayoutManager.Position.North);</code></pre>
    </td>
  </tr>

		<p class="tuthead"><span class="tutcat">Updating Database Versions</span></p>



<p>When you start producing applications for business and industry, you'll 
often find requests for new features and changes streaming in.&nbsp; Adding a 
new database field is a multi-step process.&nbsp; When it comes to changing the 
application, Habanero helps to simplify the process, so that you need only 
change the class definitions, the class implementation and the user interface 
(if not entirely defined in the class definitions).&nbsp; The result of those 
changes is a new set of EXE's or DLL's that can simply replace what the client 
has already.</p>



<p>When it comes to database changes, however, you can't simply replace an 
entire working database.&nbsp; Usually, you'd have to manually run a set of Sql 
scripts to add or remove columns.&nbsp; Updating one database is manageable, but 
multiple installations can be both tedious and prone to error - if you forget 
the update, your application will crash.&nbsp; Habanero can automate this 
database update process for 
you using the IApplicationVersionUpgrader interface and the DBMigrator class, which will 
cause the application itself to update the database automatically, so you only need to replace the application.</p>

<p class="tuthead"><span class="tutcat">Database Versioning in Practice</span></p>

<p>Back at Replace IT, we recently installed the latest version of the new system and it's 
been running smoothly.&nbsp; The databases have rapidly become populated with 
new entries.&nbsp; However, the accounts department have found the CustomerOrder 
form a little bit lacking - they're now asking for an address column.</p>



<p>We have already covered the change management process earlier on, but we'll change the
process a bit now to explain database version control.  Instead of adding the database
field and doing a class definition regeneration, simply add the new Address field
straight into the class definitions for CustomerOrder (either manually or through FireStarter).  If you're
generating user interfaces, you'll also want to amend the UI definitions so that the
Address is shown in the editing form for the CustomerOrder.</p>

<p>Next we'll implement IApplicationVersionUpgrader in the root project, which will carry out a 
version check every time it runs.&nbsp; If the database version is out-of-date, 
it will carry out any migration instructions to get it up to speed.&nbsp; You'll probably need
to add a reference to the Habanero.DB.dll in your project. Here 
is the new class:</p>

<p>To extend this for each version change, simply add more AddMigration() calls, 
and increment the version number each time.&nbsp; We'll need to point to this class right 
at the start of our application, by adding another line in Program.cs:</p>



<table class="code" border="1" cellspacing="0">
  <tbody><tr>
    <td class="codeclass" width="100%">
      <font size="2"><b>Program.cs</b> (Amended)</font>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="codeitself" width="100%">
      <pre><code>HabaneroAppWin mainApp = new HabaneroAppWin("Replace_it", "v1.0");
mainApp.ApplicationVersionUpgrader = new Replace_itVersionUpgrader();
if (!mainApp.Startup()) return;</code></pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>



<p>There's one final step: creating the database table that will store the 
version number.&nbsp; HabaneroApp supports both 
DatabaseSettings and ConfigFileSettings, but the latter can't be 
written to, so we'll need a database table called "settings", with the following 
design:</p>



<p align="center">
<img src="HabaneroTutorial_files/database-settings.gif" border="0" width="651" height="101"></p>



<p>As soon as you've created the table, add a single row with the SettingName as 
"DATABASE_VERSION" and the SettingValue as "0".&nbsp; Our application should run 
now, and a quick check on the database should show a new field for the address.&nbsp; 
Running the application again should make no change.</p>

		    	Managing Lookup-Lists
		    </font></b></td>
		  </tr>
		</tbody></table>
		<br>
		<p>In the previous section on User Interface Enhancements, we introduced
the concept of a lookup-list.  Basically, a lookup-list provides a set of
options for a control like a combobox to display.  Sometimes your lookup-list
will be a fixed list that doesn't change, as in the months of the
year.  Other times you'll want the options to be dynamic so that some
administrator can edit or add to them over time, such as the countries
of the world.  Then again, you might
allow the case where the list grows as the final users themselves add
items as they need them, such as a list of customers.</p>

<p>Because of its emphasis on UI generation, Habanero is well-designed to cope
with lookup-lists.  We have already discussed how to implement the lists,
but you may also want to be able to manage all the lookup-lists centrally.</p>

<p class="tuthead"><span class="tutcat">Adding the Computer Part Types</span></p>

Once our collection of computer parts starts to grow, we'll need a way of
categorising them.  To achieve this we'll simply create a new dynamic
lookup-list that stores all the categories in a table.  Here's the simple
database table design:

<p align="center">
<img src="HabaneroTutorial_files/database-parttype.gif" border="0"></p>

<p>In ComputerPart, we'll need a new column for ComputerPartTypeID that
will hold the primary key of the computer part type.  A foreign key is
useful to check data integrity and for Firestarter to generate the
relationships.</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="HabaneroTutorial_files/database-part_typefk.gif" border="0"></p>

<p class="tuthead"><span class="tutcat">Adding the Class Definitions</span></p>

<p>Go ahead and generate the class definitions for ComputerPartType
and ComputerPart.  The three properties in ComputerPartType will be a
Guid and two strings.  For the ComputerPartTypeID in ComputerPart,
set its lookup-list property to BusinessObjectLookupList.
There should be two relationships: a single
relationship from ComputerPart to ComputerPartType and a multiple
relationship from ComputerPartType to ComputerPart.  Also remember to add
a grid UI definition for ComputerPartType.  In ComputerPart, add the
ComputerPartType in the form and grid - Firestarter should automatically
convert the type to a ComboBox.</p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> Be aware that
with Firestarter not detecting inheritance, when you regenerate, the existing
inheritance structure might become a little corrupted.  You can either choose to auto-generate
the classes and repair the inheritance structure, or you can manually create
the ComputerPartType class, properties, relationships and UI changes in FireStarter.
Either way, it's best to use FireStarter to manage your definitions and code
generation rather than editing the XML yourself, since that will save having to
edit both the XML file and the classes in the code.</p>

<p class="tuthead"><span class="tutcat">Adding the Classes</span></p>

<p>When you regenerate your project, the new ComputerPartType class should appear.
If not, reload Visual Studio.  Importantly, you need to add a ToString() method to
the ComputerPart class, which determines what string will be shown to the user in the
ComboBox dropdown.  Displaying the Name property of the type is probably best.</p>

<p class="tuthead"><span class="tutcat">Implementing a Lookup-List Editor</span></p>

<p>Our changes are almost ready to run, except for the fact that there are no
computer part types available to choose from.  We could easily build a new form with a grid to add
some types to choose from, but you can imagine that we'd need a new form every
time we add a new lookup-list.  If you've had any experience with applications like
these, you'll know that you use lookup-lists for a wide range of options, including
customers, countries, cities, genders and many others.</p>

<p>A cleaner way of managing all your lookup-lists centrally is to use Habanero's
StaticDataEditor, which provides a treeview on the left with all the available
lookup-lists, and an editable grid on the right which allows the users to add
new items.  The implementation is really simple:</p>

<table class="code" border="1" cellspacing="0">
  <tbody><tr>
    <td class="codeclass" width="100%">
      <b><font size="2">Replace_itLookupEditor.cs</font></b>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="codeitself" width="100%">
      <pre><code>using Habanero.BO.ClassDefinition;
using Habanero.UI.Base;
using Habanero.UI.Win;
using Replace_it.BO;

namespace Replace_it.UI
{
public class Replace_itLookupEditor : UserControlWin, IFormControl
{
    public Replace_itLookupEditor(IControlFactory controlFactory)
    {
        IStaticDataEditor staticDataEditor = controlFactory.CreateStaticDataEditor();
        BorderLayoutManager layoutManager = controlFactory.CreateBorderLayoutManager(this);
        layoutManager.AddControl(staticDataEditor, BorderLayoutManager.Position.Centre);
        staticDataEditor.AddSection("Lookup lists");
        staticDataEditor.AddItem("Computer Part Types", ClassDef.ClassDefs[typeof(ComputerPartType)]);
    }

    public void SetForm(IFormHabanero form) {}
}
}</code></pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>As you can see, it's easy to add new types to this editor - simply use the AddItem method.
As before you'll need to add this form to the Form Controller and include a main menu
item to access it.</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="HabaneroTutorial_files/app-lookupeditor.jpg">
</p>

<p class="tuthead"><span class="tutcat">Adding Options on the Fly</span></p>

<p>Habanero also provides a feature where users can right-click
on a ComboBox to add options immediately.  This service requires a UI form definition to
have been created in the XML class definitions.</p>

		<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Log4net is a system used by Habanero for logging output from 
your application.&nbsp; Log files give you assistance in several ways, including 
analysing system faults remotely, tracking system usage, tracing the process 
that led to a breakdown and understanding where the system failed when you don't 
have any other visual response.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Habanero logs output to this logging
system, and you can use logging calls in your code to add to this
output.&nbsp; Log4net is highly flexible, allowing you to specify the
log output medium (eg. text file), the output format and the output
detail level (eg. errors only, or all debug information).</font></p>

<p class="tuthead"><span class="tutcat">Setting Up Logging Support</span></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The settings are laid out in the app.config 
file (or your equivalent config file) between the configuration tags.&nbsp; 
First declare the "log4net" settings type in "configSections" as follows:</font></p>

<table class="code" border="1" cellspacing="0">
  <tbody><tr>

    <td class="codeitself" width="100%">
    <pre><code>&lt;configSections&gt;

&lt;/configSections&gt;</code></pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Then specify the "log4net" settings - here is 
an example which you could use:</font></p>

<font size="2" face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica">

    </font><table class="code" border="1" cellspacing="0">
  <tbody><tr>

<td class="codeitself" width="100%">
    <pre><code>&lt;log4net&gt;
  &lt;appender name="FileAppender" type="log4net.Appender.FileAppender"&gt;
    &lt;param name="File" value="log.txt"/&gt;
    &lt;param name="AppendToFile" value="true"/&gt;
    &lt;layout type="log4net.Layout.PatternLayout"&gt;
      &lt;param name="ConversionPattern" value="%d [%t] %-5p %c [%x] - %m%n"/&gt;
    &lt;/layout&gt;
  &lt;/appender&gt;
  &lt;root&gt;
    &lt;level value="INFO"/&gt;

  &lt;/root&gt;
&lt;/log4net&gt;</code></pre>
    </td>
    
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The settings above specify the log output file 
name, that the existing file will append new data, the output format and that all output 
of type "INFO" or more serious will be logged.&nbsp; "DEBUG" is the 
lowest level and will display all types of logging output.</font></p>

<p class="tuthead"><span class="tutcat">Using Logging in Your Own Code</span></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">To use logging in your own code, you'll need to 
setup a logger in each class where you want to send logging output.&nbsp; 
Include "log4net" as follows:</font></p>

<table class="code" border="1" cellspacing="0">
  <tbody><tr>

    <td class="codeitself" width="100%">
    <pre><code>using log4net;</code></pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Then add the logging object to your class fields like this:</p>

<table class="code" border="1" cellspacing="0">
  <tbody><tr>

    <td class="codeitself" width="100%">
    <pre><code>private static readonly ILog log = LogManager.GetLogger("yourClassName");</code></pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Finally you can send log output anywhere in the code of that class like this:</p>

<table class="code" border="1" cellspacing="0">
  <tbody><tr>

    <td class="codeitself" width="100%">
    <pre><code>log.Info("The application is starting...");
log.Debug("System variable set to: xyz");
log.Error("An error has occurred in the startup section.");</code></pre>
    </td>

<p class="tuthead"><span class="tutcat">User-Friendly Error Form</span></p>

<p><font size="2">The HabaneroAppWin class has an ExceptionNotifier property, which 
allows you to specify a standard form to display error messages (do this before 
calling Startup).&nbsp; This form must implement IExceptionNotifier.&nbsp; By 
default, Habanero supplies its own error display form, which hides the messy 
details from a final user, but still allows a developer to view the stack trace.&nbsp; 
While the form will automatically popup during the program launch, during normal 
run-time, you will need to enclose the code in a try-catch block.&nbsp; Here is 
a sample implementation in Program.cs, the root class.</font></p>
<table class="code" border="1" cellspacing="0">
  <tbody><tr>
    <td class="codeitself" width="100%"><pre><code>using Habanero.Base;</code></pre></td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><font size="2">And in the Main() method:</font></p>
<table class="code" border="1" cellspacing="0">
  <tbody><tr>
    <td class="codeitself" width="100%"><pre><code>try
{
    Application.EnableVisualStyles();
    Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(false);

catch (Exception ex)
{
    GlobalRegistry.UIExceptionNotifier.Notify(ex,
    "An error has occurred in the application.",
    "Application Error");
}</code></pre></td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>You can also mask the exception so that naive users aren't hit with the full 
details of a complicated error message:</p>

<table class="code" border="1" cellspacing="0">
  <tbody><tr>
    <td class="codeitself" width="100%"><pre><code>GlobalRegistry.UIExceptionNotifier.Notify(

you make changes, and then run them again after each change.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Habanero uses nUnit to carry out unit testing, so install nUnit as necessary.</li>
  <li>The tests can be run centrally from the "Habanero.nunit" file.</li>
  <li>The tests use a MySQL database to carry out persistence checks.  You will
  need to install MySQL and restore the test database (located in the "docs" directory).
  You will also need to provide a connection string for the database.</li>
  <li>The connection string is hardcoded to (localhost, 3306, root, root) - if you have
  a different connection string, amend the Habanero.Test.MyDBConnection class</li>

<ul>

<font size="2" face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica">

  <li><b>Application is not working</b><ul>
    <li>Is the code correct?</li>
    <li>Do you have an app.config file that is correctly configured?</li>
    <li>Do you have a classdefs.xml file and is it accessible in the output 
    folder with the executables?</li>
    <li>Does the class definition have the required basic elements?</li>
    <li>Is there a class element for each class,

<font size="2" face="Verdana">

    a class for each class element and a database table for each class element?</font></li>
    <li>Do all the table names and field names match up case-sensitively with 
    both the database field names and the properties in the class? (If in doubt, 
    add a table attribute to your class element)</li>
    <li>Are their any property names misspelt in the rest of the class 
    definitions?</li>
    <li>Are all the data types correct in your classes, the class definitions and the 
    database?</li>
  </ul>
  </li>

<font size="2" face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica">

  <li><b>"Object reference not set to an instance of an object."</b><ul>

<li>This is a .Net error thrown when a null reference is being encountered.&nbsp; 
This is a common exception that can be thrown for a wide range of activities, 
so you'll need to do some further research to try and isolate the code that is 
throwing the exception.</li>

</ul>
  </li>
</font>

</font>

  <li><b>Class definitions</b><ul>
  <li>Classdefs.xml not found<ul>
  <li>While the class definitions may be stored under your project or assembly, 
  they need to be copied to your execution directory as well (eg. bin, debug, 
  output).&nbsp; Either add a build command to copy the file at run-time or use 
  a feature like Visual Studio's where you can set the properties on 
  "classdefs.xml" so that it is copied to the output directory.</li>
</ul>
  </li>
  <li>Can't find control, mapper or assembly for a field/grid control<ul>
  <li>Apart from checking for the obvious (does the type or mapper exist in the 
  assembly as specified?), check that the assembly you're referring to has been 
  referenced in the relevant project (try referencing it in the other projects 
  if you've got multiple ones).</li>
</ul>
  </li>
</ul>
  </li>

<font size="2">

  <li><b>Database issues</b><ul>
  <li>Changes not being saved to database<ul>
  <li>If you edit an object in a default form, the changes should be committed 
  automatically, but if you edit values at code level, you need to call Save() on the object to commit the changes.</li>
  <li>You cannot edit a primary key, Habanero blocks this edit.&nbsp; For this 
  reason, once an object has been created, you should either not make the field 
  available for editing, or set the field's "editable" attribute to false.</li>
</ul>
  </li>
  <li>Null values being saved in not-null fields<ul>
  <li>Empty strings are not null.&nbsp; Ensure that you have catered for the 
possibility of empty strings - some counter strategies include adding a unique 
key constraint on the field or placing a "minLength" rule on a property.</li>
</ul>
  </li>
  <li>Initial values show in form or grid, but they save as null<ul>
  <li>Because controls like CheckBoxes have no way of 
  showing null, it is up to the developer to add a default value to the property 
  in the class definitions, using the "default" attribute in the "property" 
  element.</li>
</ul>
  </li>
</ul>
  </li>
  </font>

<font size="2">

  <li><b>User interface issues</b><ul>
  <li>ComboBox displaying wrong information<ul>
  <li>There are two means to display data in a ComboBox using the class 
  definitions.&nbsp; You can specify a set list of options using 
  "attribute" elements (see Appendix I), or you can set the list to be dynamically 
  loaded when the form comes up, using the lookup-list source options.&nbsp; 
  These need a pair of strings and Guids, with the strings displayed to the user 
  and the Guids stored in the property values.&nbsp; Your property type therefore 
  needs to be a Guid.</li>
</ul>
  </li>

<font size="2" face="Verdana">

  <li>No objects appear in the grid<ul>
  <li>When you create a business object collection to pass to the grid, you need 
  to load the objects in the collection using the collection's Load() or LoadAll() command.</li>
</ul>
  </li>
  <li>Can't edit a date<ul>
  <li>You are unable to edit a DateTime property in a textbox.&nbsp; Rather use 
  a DateTimePicker (along with the DateTimePickerMapper), which are easier to 
  use and have better error checking.</li>
</ul>
  </li>
  </font>
</ul>
  </li>
  </font>

<font size="2">

</font><ul>

<font size="2"><li>Why do I get an empty form?<ul>
  <li>If you've created an form-based application and nothing is showing in your 
  form, then you need to decide what to show in the form, such as a grid 
  containing your data or a menu that opens other grids or forms.&nbsp; See the 
  tutorial on examples for displaying data in a form using Habanero.</li>
  <li>If you've set a grid to display and have no data showing in the grid, even 
  though there is a data in the database, ensure that you called the Load() 
  command on the business object collection, or that you didn't use criteria 
  that the data couldn't adhere to.</li>
</ul>
  </li>

</font></ul>

<font size="2"><li><b>Naming issues</b><ul>

<li>Dashes in the assembly name<ul>

<li>In Visual Studio, putting a dash in the assembly name will result in an 
underscore in the namespace.&nbsp; This will cause failures with Habanero - 
while we create a workaround for this problem, we suggest you avoid using dashes 
in the assembly names.</li>

</ul>
</li>

</ul>
