NOTE:
Sandcastle is a Microsoft product that is under development, so refer back to their
site for the latest improvements.  It is a command-line tool, so there are some free
products made by others to provide a front-end GUI.

Check the latest developments at Microsoft.  Also see the Chillisoft wiki page on how to
document code and build help files.

I've looked at two leading GUI's:
- SandcastleGUI
- Sandcastle help file builder (.shfb files) - this is my favourite

The installers are located in T:\DeveloperPCInstalls\Optional\Help File Builders

Using Sandcastle help file builder
  - copy appropriate files to the Build directory (see the help text file)
  - update the class definitions html too
  - double click on the .shfb file, amend the version number, assemblies and compile
  - the compile should take a while, otherwise deal with the errors it shows
  - copy the CHM output file to the right docs folder
